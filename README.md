# User container

The user container is an example container that can be used to develop on the robot. It comes pre-installed with ROS and the necessary dependencies to run the robot.

We have two variants of the user container. One for the Vertex, and one for the Origin. The files for these variants are located in the [`vertex`](https://github.com/avular-robotics/user-container/tree/vertex) and [`origin`](https://github.com/avular-robotics/user-container/tree/origin) branches respectively.

Go to these branches for more information on how to build and run the containers.
